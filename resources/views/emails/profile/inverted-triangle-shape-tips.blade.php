    When it comes to the  hourglass  shape, it has been  considered the ideal  body shape through out 
    most of history. The hourglass body shape is  defined by  big curves and a small  waist. However,  
    creating the perfect outfit can still be even trickier for the hourglass body type. You should aim to 
    balance out your proportions and avoid accentuating your curves too much. These tips brought to 
    you thanks to the Tallah styling experts, will help you feel confident in your outfits.

    <div class="section-content">
      <ol class="section-list">
        <li>
          Do try out V-necklines. They will compliment your natural body shape nicely.
        </li>
        <li>
           Do wear a sweetheart neckline. It will follow the curls of your body. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Do go for keyhole tops. They will emphasize your curls, while still looking modest. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't wear tops with a wide neckline. The hourglass body shape is 
          naturally balanced, and you don't want to disrupt this balance.
          Don't go for high necklines. They can make the upper area of your body appear heavy

    <div class="section-content">
      <ol class="section-list">
        <li>
          Do wear wrap dresses. This silhouette will look very flattering on
          your body shape as it will complement both the upper and lower
          part of your body. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Do experiment with form-fitting dresses. You can try out form-
          fitting dresses as they will follow the shape of your body, which is
          already in balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do wear dresses with built-in belts. These types of dresses will 
          sinch in at your waist, creating a flattering silhouette. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't go for dresses that have a wide skirt and a form-fitting top.
          This can disrupt the natural proportions of your body. 
        </li>

    <div class="section-content">
      <ol class="section-list">
        <li>
          Do try pencil skirts. They are narrower at the waist and will 
          thereforehelp your shape lookeven.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do go for voluminous skirts as they will further accentuate your waist.
          Don't wear skirts made out of stiff fabric.They will look boxy, which
          isn't what you want.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't go for short skirts with a straight cut. This can cause your 
          silhouette to appear bottom-heavy.

        <li>
          Do wear slightly flared pants, as they will contrast your curves.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do choose high-waisted pants.This style is great for the hourglass 
          shape as it makes the legs appear longer. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't go for low-rise pants. This type of pants can make your
