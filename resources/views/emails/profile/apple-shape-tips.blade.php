      <ol class="section-list">
        <li>
          Do wear a V-neckline.Tops with a V-neckline will draw attention to your decolletage and neck 
        </li>
        <li>
          Do wear tops made of thicker materials.These kinds of tops are great
          for the apple body shape,as the material will not budge and sit in weird
          places.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do go strapless. Don't be afraid to show some skin!
        </li>
        <li>
          Do wear tops  with  sleeves that  flare out. Sophisticated  sleeves will 
          draw the  attention away from your belly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't go for closed tops like a turtleneck, as they will make your
          shoulders appear wider.

        </li>
        <li>

           will draw the attention upwards.
        </li>
        <li>
